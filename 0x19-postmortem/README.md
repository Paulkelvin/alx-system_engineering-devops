# Postmortem Report

## Issue Summary

- **Duration of Outage**: October 11, 2023, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM UTC (2 hours).
- **Impact**: Roughly 48% of users experienced slow data retrieval and timeouts, affecting our service's reliability.
- **Root Cause**: A recently updated feature caused a memory leak, depleting server resources.

## Timeline

- `2:00 PM UTC` - Performance degradation alerts received from automated monitoring systems; team notified.
- `2:15 PM UTC` - Investigations pointed to a surge in user traffic; server capacity was increased.
- `2:45 PM UTC` - Application log review shifted suspicion to recent deployments.
- `3:00 PM UTC` - Investigation diverted to consider issues with external API services.
- `3:30 PM UTC` - Incident escalated to senior DevOps for deeper system-level investigation.
- `3:50 PM UTC` - Memory leak identified in a newly released feature.
- `4:00 PM UTC` - Hotfix deployed, leading to normalized system performance.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause**: The new feature's background data processing improperly held onto server memory, causing increasing consumption until resources were fully depleted, leading to service degradation.
- **Resolution**: A hotfix was deployed to correct the memory handling process, servers were rebooted, and traffic was rerouted during system recovery.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes**: The incident highlighted the need for enhanced testing and refined alert mechanisms for early detection.
- **List of Tasks**:
  1. **Expand testing protocols**: Incorporate memory leak detection tools in the development cycle.
  2. **Monitoring system upgrade**: Implement detailed memory usage metrics and intelligent anomaly alerts.
  3. **Streamline rollback processes**: Enhance rollback procedures for problematic deployments.
  4. **System patching**: Plan for a comprehensive patch to pre-empt similar issues across services.
  5. **Broad performance auditing**: Initiate a system-wide audit for potential risks.
  6. **In-depth team training**: Organize workshops on code optimization and resource management.

*Our commitment remains strong in bolstering system resilience and ensuring an uninterrupted, secure, and efficient user experience.*
