# 🚨 The Great System Outage of October 11: A Post-Mortem! 🚨

Hello, dear readers! Grab your favorite snack and beverage, because today, we're diving into the epic tale of how a sneaky memory leak brought our mighty application to its virtual knees!

## 😱 The Horror Begins: Issue Summary

- **🕰️ Duration of Outage**: Picture this - it was a dark and stormy afternoon on October 11, 2023. For two whole hours, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM UTC, our digital fortress faced its nemesis.
- **💥 Impact**: Around 48% of our dear users (we still love the other 52%, don't worry!) faced the dreaded "slow response" monster and its sidekick, the evil timeout.
- **🕵️ Root Cause**: Amidst the digital storm, a memory leak, birthed by a recent software update, consumed our resources like a hungry kid left alone at a candy store.

## ⏰ A Race Against Time: The Timeline

- `2:00 PM UTC` - Our alarms screamed like banshees! Something was rotten in the kingdom of OurApplication!
- `2:15 PM UTC` - Initial troops thought it was just a barrage of user traffic. More servers were summoned to the battlefield.
- `2:45 PM UTC` - A spy named Application Log hinted that the enemy was within—a recent deployment gone rogue.
- `3:00 PM UTC` - A red herring! External API services were accused, but they had watertight alibis.
- `3:30 PM UTC` - We cried for help, sending ravens to the senior DevOps wizards.
- `3:50 PM UTC` - AHA! The memory leak monster was spotted, hiding in a new feature's cloak.
- `4:00 PM UTC` - With a mighty digital sword (a.k.a. the hotfix), the monster was slain, and peace returned to the server kingdom!

## 🛠️ Heroes Arise: Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause**: A new feature, which was supposed to be our knight in shining armor, turned out to be a memory-hoarding dragon, setting our system ablaze.
- **Resolution**: Our DevOps wizards forged a magical hotfix, mending the dragon's ways, while our server steeds got some well-earned rest (read: reboot).

## 🌟 The Moral of the Story: Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes**: Like all great tales, ours has a moral too! We need stronger shields (more testing), sharper swords (better monitoring), and faster steeds (quicker rollback procedures).
- **List of Tasks**:
  1. Train our knights harder (more rigorous testing protocols, especially for memory usage).
  2. Build a taller watchtower (upgrade our monitoring system).
  3. Practice our swordplay (streamline rollback processes).
  4. Forge stronger armor (comprehensive system patching).
  5. Trust in our seers (broad performance auditing).
  6. Share tales of battle (team training sessions).

And so, dear reader, our tale ends. But fear not! OurApplication's kingdom is safer, stronger, and ready for whatever monsters come our way! 🏰💪
